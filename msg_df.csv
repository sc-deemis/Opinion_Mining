1,2,"not only is infection a possibility (bladder infections, vaginal infections), but mucous membranes become sore and inflamed with taxotere (it's called ""mucositis"")."
2,3,"thank god for herceptin which   hopefully fixes this  . i have stage 1 / 1 1/2cm/ no nodes involved and if it weren't for  her2+, i probably would not have needed chemo at all-6 sessions of tchevery 3 weeks plus an addtional year of herceptin every 3 weeks--and i probably would have only had to dojust 5 sessions of mammo site radiation, instead of 7 weeks 5x a week of regular full radiation."
3,4,"hi - taking doxil monthly, dose 17 was today. i have found it mild   (much easier than gemzar, navelbine and/or taxol!). have residual neuropathy from  others, but not any worse on doxil."
4,5,i did adriamycin and cytoxan. after surgery i did taxotere as well. i think they would have done  taxotere before surgery as well but i was pregnant and that drug was not safe for baby. i want to give you a warning since you are so young that cytoxan is  classic example of a chemo drug that will destroy your fertility!!!!
5,6,"claire: i did a/c and taxol. lost my hair on a/c, was told   it would start to grow back on   taxol."
6,7,"i started a trial about a month ago with femara and bkm120 experimental drug. i have a scan on november 1st to see if femara and   drug is working with  trial i am on  . i failed on all others and have failed on xeloda and taxol recently within  last two years. taxol was last, that is when we found liver stuff. i guess i am just hoping trial is doing something but not so sure femara and this other drug can kick all this cancer back."
7,8,"after 4 taxoteres, one toenail is history (hooray for it not being flipflop season),    other 19 nails on  fingers and toes are holding their own so far  ."

9,10,my protocol was 4 weeks of ac and i am now on 4 treatments of taxotere/docetaxel.
10,11,"although some of us have docetaxel (taxotere) and others have paclitaxel (taxol), we have to remember they are both taxanes and probably doing more or less  same things, and having  same side effects. when i first started reading  threads, i thought it seemed more common for taxol to be used in  us and taxotere to be used in  uk and europe. i did ask my oncologist why she had chosen taxotere for me and she said it was because   it was less harmful to  heart   than taxol. it is frightening to know that  drug manufacturer of taxotere now states that 7% of users could end up with permanent or partial hair loss. i would think it is  same with taxol."
11,12,"i had 6 triple strength treatments of taxotere and cytoxin (i'm way overweight, so that's why  extra strength) before surgery in order to shink  tumor first."
12,13,"taxol is   so much easier   than ac was, but i rode every weekend then as well."

15,16,i have had 8 weeks of abraxane (4 months of avastin) treatment and   i still have my hair  .
16,17,"i decided not to take  tamoxifen for many reasons too. i did as much research as i was capable of at  time - in my depressed, tired battered and bruised state, and from what i read, i didnt feel that as a young 38 year old woman tamoxifen was a drug i wanted to take. i talked to a woman in my town who'd had bc many years before, and had taken tamoxifen. her diet and exercise routine remained unchanged, but on tamoxifen she gained 30kg (which i think is around 66 pounds) and when she went off tamoxifen she lost about half of that without even trying - so you cant tell me that tamoxifen didnt put that weight on her. prospect of life with tamoxifen was just too much to bear. i struggle all  time with lack of support and depression - i cant imagine  se's of tamoxifen on top of that. i thought this seemed to me like what is going on now with women being told to take tamoxifen and whilst it's true that you cant compare  two things, my point is that back then these concepts were accepted as being true and  norm."
17,18,and now i am almost done with  five years of tamoxifen (less than two months to go).
18,19,"i did this for 5 months, i gained weight back and it gave  tamoxifen time to work."

27,28,
28,29,you need a port with adriamycin(sp). tc is not associated with  heart risks of adriamycin (sp) so they typically do not do muga scans for it.
29,30,
30,31,could you also put  why's and what's about ac and taxol on here cause my onco also said it was    best treatment   for tn's today when i saw her today.

34,35,"i think it's worth a try.http://en.allexperts.com/q/hair-loss-1012/retin-hair-loss.htmpersonally, iweighed out all  factors, and because of a heart murmur, and wanted to avoid adriamycin, i thought tc was still  best choice for me."

36,37,"i had been on tamoxifen and   it didnt seem to be working for me  . i had a total hysterectomy at age 39, but before i had been on  zoladex shots for some time."
37,38,began chemo jan 2010 - 3 fec and 3 taxotere was original plan - but severe gi side effects from fec landed me in hospital after 2nd - so switched to ec only for third. then 12 weekly taxol which has been   easier on my gi tract   (i have previous ulcerative colitis - and have no bowel - but have a jpouch so chemo did a number on me). i am almost done taxol - 2 more go go and   hasn't been too too bad   - neuropathy biggest issue - doc just lowered dose to 80% last week which has helped.
38,39,"so, i believe i have had my 35th and last dose of abraxane due to toxicity, she named xeloda as   being a good one  ."
39,40,for any of you facing radiation after your taxol - i justi found this on another site and thought it was worth sharing here.

42,43,"12 weekly taxol was another story! (the exhaustion rapidly left starting a week after last infusion even though i started rads a week after last taxol. i slept through all my taxols - as soon as they would start  iv benadryl i'd go 'nighty night' waking up as abruptly 15 minutes before end. 1/2 way through taxol, i started having problems with keeping my k (potassium) levels up close to 'normal', so went on mega doses of k (still have to take k to keep it up - zn and mg stay good). it's 5 years since i was on taxol."
43,44,
44,45,mine is from doxil and it hurts to walk.
45,46,
46,47,"i felt really well   after chemo and rads but, like you, was very reluctant to take tamoxifen but have now been taking it for 5 months. so if i'm not worrying about cancer i'm worrying about bloody tamoxifen. oh and my white blood count is low and i'm convinced it's  tamoxifen."
47,48,i had my first neulasta shot with my 3rd round of cytoxan/taxotere and took  claritin.
48,49,"dr. martin says his team found that a popular chemotherapy drug, taxol,   actually causes cancer cell microtentacles to grow longer and allows tumor cells to reattach faster  , which may have important treatment implications for breast cancer patients. if you treat people with taxol before surgery to shrink  primary tumor, levels of circulating tumor cells go up 1,000 to 10,000 fold, potentially increasing metastasis,"" he adds."
49,50,
50,51,"i just started my 6th cycle of 125 mg ibrance/letrozole, then will scan again at end of month to confirm that i need to move on (but hoping for a miracle since   tm's were dropping   and since i'm   feeling well   despite  scans). welcome to  thread, ashley, and good luck with  ibrance. only real side effects i've had are  low blood counts (white blood cell count was 780 last week so i had to take a few days off) and tiredness, but they always seem to rebound in a few days, at least enough to go back on  ibrance. monika, my opinion is to stick with  zantac 150 and watch your diet on ibrance, and take tums as needed. at first i heard that a trial at dana farber was prohibiting prilosec while on ibrance (you can do a search and see conversation on prilosec - it is different from zantac since it releases for 24 hours), but my doctor said that ban is no longer in effect. however, i decided to stick with zantac since it has been around longer and does not seem as controversial, and does not release for 24 hours which sounds like it could interfere with ibrance. my doctor said to try to take my heartburn med as far away from  ibrance as possible (11 hours away was suggested, and i think at least 4 hours away from all meds for tums, but you should ask your onc to confirm as there are differing opinions)."
51,52,magda: i hope you have minimal ses from  zoladex. i thought i'd dodged  taxol nail issues because i kept them polished all through treatment.
52,53,"had my first taxotere/ herceptin/ perjeta infusion today,   went much better then i expected  . decadron and benadryl   worked or at least helped  , got good news on my ultrasound,   cancer has shrunk 40%   from  4 cycles of a/c, mo is very pleased and so am i, means all this crap is doing something."

59,60,"i'm newly diagnosed, and started with carboplatin and taxotere in  hope that i could get my eggs harvested and frozen before round 2 three weeks later. now i've been switched to doxorubicin and carboplatin, however my nurse dropped  news on me that my onc wants to switch to every 4 weeks as  doxo hangs out longer."
60,61,"tamox can screw up your period, but does not cause actual menopause like chemo can. if you are in menopause from chemo, tamox will improve those symptoms because it acts like estrogen in  body. i recommend all women get their hormone levels checked regularly including a reading on their ovarian reserve so you know what is a side effect of tamoxifen (there are so very many) or what is menopause from chemo. tamox causes ses that are similar to ses of being in menopause, but important to know it's not menopause, just ses of  drug. since tamox acts like estrogen in  body, it may be causing  cysts."
61,62,"my mom developed bc three years ago, which was supposed to be dcis but turned out to be stage iia with 2+ nodes requiring 4 rounds of ac and 4 rounds of t plus radiation, tamoxifen, lumpectomy and re-excision."
62,63,this taxotere   has been hard on me  --still taking oxycodone at night so i can sleep.

64,65,"karebear76, i will give you a little rundown on how i have been handling  steroid rollercoaster:tues: taxol, then i eat everything in sight,   feel ok, actually sleep ok  wed: still on  eating train,   still feeling ok, sleeping ok   (ativan ativan ativan! !all in all, though, i   like   taxol better, i am on 8 weekly. i feel more ""normal-ish""   on taxol, like i can go out and socialize more.i have started having tinglies in my hands and feet, but they go away as quick as they come on, for now, i still have 6 more treatments to go, so we will see!!"
65,66,"i am still going through herceptin and   thats not so bad,   tamoxifen gives me a few se but dealing."
66,67,"once i recuperated from that surgery i went through 6+ months of chemo - 12rounds in total getting taxotere, 5fu and cisplatin."
67,68,"i know they didn't have herceptin, tamoxifen, etc."
68,69,:)   i'm doing very well   - tamoxifen and zoladex   are not too bad  . last thing is  hope to take a break from tamoxifen in  next year to have a baby.
69,70,
70,71,"i had a lumpectomy for it in 2001, 5 years of tamoxifen and it came back asap i quit taking  tamoxifen."
71,72,tomorrow to start up my 12 weeks of taxol.
72,73,"hey, i just had two treatments of fec - two more to come and then four of taxotere."
73,74,i must be  only person who's having a harder time with taxol than with ac.
74,75,"i originally posted this on  arimidex thread, i'm also posting here at  suggestion of dunesleeper:haven't been on  sight for quite some time. i've been on anastrozole since diagnosis, 12/1/13. bone pain increased, i don't know if it's from anastrozole, xgeva or mets. is swelling and pain in previous osteoarthritis sights a se of anastrozole or should i be asking these questions on  this bone mets thread?"
75,76,now i am taking arimidex.
76,77,"according toall  guidelines, ishould have had chemofollowed by a year of herceptin butto me,  risksfar outweighed  benefits. i knew that my immune system had been compromised due to stress and fatigue during theyear before my diagnosis, and i felt strongly that losing weight,repairingmy immunesystem rather than destroying it, and taking tamoxifen to ward off any escaped cells from my highly estrogen driven tumor rather than delaying it for more that a year until after chemo and herceptin   is my best bet for a long healthy life  . my experience taking  tamoxifen   has not been a big issue for me  . i saw my sister-in-law stop taking  tamoxifenthat she had been on in a clinical trialshortly after itbecame fda approved, and suddenly went from being provided to her for free as part of  trial to costing hundreds of dollars a month that she couldn't afford. tamoxifen   seems like my best chance for a future with ned,   so at this point, i'm embracing those side effects as a sign  stuff is working."
77,78,sarah: i am on my 4th taxotere/cytoxan treatment and i can say that my swelling came after  3rd treatment.
78,79,"i got a tiny bit of neuropathy in my left hand that i attribute from  taxotere, but it seems to be a little better and i can still button shirts, type fast, and put earrings in, so it isn't very bad."
79,80,
80,81,"i had my last taxol in early june, then carboplatin once a week until august 1. my neuropathy started around  second dose dense taxol in early may. i saw some initial improvement after stopping taxol, but then it regressed  2nd week of carboplatin - though to it's worst state. is there still hope for recovery this far out from treatment and given i have seen no improvement since 2 weeks post taxol (back in june)?????"
81,82,"i was on chemo from nov 2004 to july 2005 then went on femara (hormonal) for 20 months. when that finally failed me, i went back on chemo (taxol/avastin, then navelbine/avastin) for 13 months. when that sent me to   ned  ,  onc put me on aromasin (hormonal). i am almost convinced that  aromasin would have worked for a longer period of time, but my dad died suddenly in july 2008 and my stress level went straight through  roof. meanwhile, back on navelbine/avastin (and something for  neuropathy if you please)."
82,83,"i did find that a few of my side effect actually kicked in after i had finished on taxotere, so don't be alarmed if you nails go brown or anything unless you were on ac. keep us posted on how  arimadex is going as most of us will be on it later."
83,84,
84,85,beth - i'm on dose dense ac and will do 12 rounds of taxol after.
85,86,
86,87,i have used avastin on in off for three years. taxotere will make you loose your hair.
87,88,yes you take tamoxifen. tamoxifen has   destroyed my bones  .
88,89,"i have scanned through all of your comments and questions, and i have a few answers and comments myself.1) bazedoxifene (bza for simplicity) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (serm) just like tamoxifen is. capriness above, be sure that your dr understands that raloxifene won't cut ice here and it needs to be bza.2) bza works similarly to faslodex, but   is much more patient friendly   (oral), and we   expect it will be more effective  , because it is much more readily taken up by  body."
89,90,i was fine   when i was on tamoxifen.
90,91,i had my second doxil last friday and i'm feeling exhausted again. i dread going back to  wig routine i had with taxotere but i hate wearing hats and i'm just not brave enough to go topless!
91,92,"and i've done 4 of  12 taxols. when you get to  taxol you can take 12 smaller doses, i call them ""chemo lite"" and have basically   no side effects  . if you find  taxol is hard on you ask your onc about  lite doses."
92,93,"i think  effects of taxol are accumulative because   i seem to feel progressively worse after each treatment   :( my hubs is going into work today but then he took  rest of  week off as ""vacation"" i am of course, home today but working  rest of  week."
93,94,i also had  sinus thing with  cytoxan but they said they would slow it down from 20 to 30 minutes next tx to resolve  sinus irritation.
94,95,i start tamoxifen on jan. 1.
95,96,"started xeloda yesterday 2,000 mg twice daily. had stable innumerable bone mets throughout my skeleton for over a year on clinical trial drug and exemestane but just had progression to my bone marrow."
96,97,and in my toes following taxotere.
97,98,"2timeri go weekly for my taxol but   so far, #5 it has been much easier   than  a&c."

99,100,"taxol tx, mo told me to use cortisone 10 or extra-strength."
100,101,"thank you for  input on arimidex, i am scared of changing over. as for  wine, it doesn't interfere with tamoxifen in any way, but, yes, alcohol (not wine in particular, beer is just as bad) has been found to stimulate  growth of breast cancer cells. is that  tamoxifen or just menopause?"
101,102,"hi cat123i had dose dense adriamycin and cyclophosphamide x 4 followed by 4 rounds of taxol, also dose dense."
102,103,so now i'm on carboplatin and irinotecan (camposar).
103,104,"i am scheduled for 4-6 cycles of tc then radiation then tamoxifen:-( i am planning on using  penguin cold caps to preserve my hair while going through chemo, i   heard alot of positive feedback from pple who are currently using them or have used them in  past  ."
104,105,"i'm on weekly taxol/carboplatin and   i don't have any nausea   but i do have more acid reflux than usual. in 2005, i did dose-dense ac x4, taxol x4, with neulasta shots. taxol made me achy, and  neulasta made my bones hurt. worst side effect is fatigue, but i think that's more  carboplatin."
105,106,
106,107,"she did tch (6x tc) prior to double mastectomy 10/09 (7 nodes involved as well), continued with herceptin and did rads x37. he tried her on two different ai's (more on this later) and she went into a profound depression with each, so she went to tamoxifen. she was hospitalized in jan '10 with a pulmonary embolism (perhaps caused to herceptin), and has been on coumadin ever since with regular monitoring of inr. now, a week before christmas, we learned that she has several small lymph nodes in her chest that were hot, along with a small tumor on one adrenal gland. next, he says we'll go with xeloda/tykerb. day before it arrived, i researched xeloda, and discovered an fda black box warning for interactions with coumadin. they got us in on  23rd, a wonderful onc spent a few hours with us until 7 pm (when everyone else had left to begin their holiday), and she presented some clinical trials that she thought would benefit my wife so that we might keep xeloda available later. we were told that if my wife started  xeloda we had at home, she'd be ineligible. so we pondered it over  holiday while starting tykerb without xeloda."
107,108,"i'm a bit confused about  paragraph on what estrogen does because my mo told me that  tamoxifen is   good for my bones, heart and cholesterol  . my grandpa's 98 yr old girlfriend fell down a flight of wooden stairs last year, didn't break a single bone, and her doc said it was because she had been on tamoxifen in  past after having bc. i'm building muscle really well, and my husband who has always been a weight lifter said some male body builders take tamoxifen to block any small amount of estrogen they may have and it helps them build muscles bigger and quicker. i don't know how they get ahold of  tamoxifen though."
108,109,i went through 6 round of chemo (3 fec and 3 taxorete).
109,110,
110,111,i started carboplatin in april and will continue with that. taxotere   was great for me   but i had to quit because  neuropathy in my fingers and toes was getting worse. i hope  taxotere is as good for your mom as it was for me!
111,112,"julie, according to pat,  fluorouracil is 5-fu which i did have when i did  cmf chemo. cream that he gives you is biafine."
112,113,"i finished taxol on july 2. toenails-i kept expecting to loose a few during taxol, it didn't happen  ."
113,114,after 3 years with ais i have switched to tamoxifen.
114,115,"when mine got so bad that i wanted to quit tamoxifen, that's what i did. my bs said when i started tamoxifen that it gives me a 50% reduction in  risk of recurrence and i think that's a pretty big number to give up when there may be help for you."
115,116,"i guess with taxol our biggest concerns will be, our nails, taste buds, and drinking enough to protect our bladders. i took arimidex (estrogen sucking drug) for a month because we were delaying surgery about 6 weeks."
116,117,"debsue, i doubt if it's  benadryl that is making you sick so long after your infusion. my chemo regimen was taxotere & cytoxan. taxotere sometimes causes severe allergic reactions during  infusion, so oncos give us dexamethasone (decadron) and antihistamines to reduce that risk. i think most women on my chemo regimen get benadryl as a pre-med infusion. i never got benadryl. benadryl   just works really well  ."
117,118,going to try icing my feet and hands tomorrow during  taxotere to help with neuropathy and damage to nails.
118,119,"he said that for her stage, he wouldn't suggest folfox4 and if anything, he would go with 5fu in  pill form of xeloda."
119,120,"her2 +++, er/pr -, lb mastectomy, chemo 4 rounds a/c, herceptin not available to early stagers in 2004. oct 07 started weekly taxol/herceptin for 3 weeks with 1 week off. she has never had any symptoms of her mets and still doesn't, no pain nothing, she has   no side effects   from chemo at all, a little bit of a runny nose once in a while from herceptin."
120,121,
121,122,njl-knitter--not everyone has problems with tamoxifen so don't let everything you read scare you. but my mo worked with me and i have now been on tamox for 4 1/2 months and can say   all  se's have worked themselves out  . to me  insurance of  tamox is worth it.
122,123,"i'm taking arimadex and  only thing i can complain about there is that it messes with my joints, especially finger joints (mainly thumbs) which get a bit stiff and irritated but as  day progresses it eases off."
123,124,"i am supposed to start tamoxifen within  next few weeks though, that could change real soon."
124,125,
125,126,they said i'd get that with  taxol.
126,127,"i started arimidex 4 months ago. put me on topral and told me it is from adriamycin. arimidex   se not intolerable  . feel like  topral and arimidex aren't ""playing"" well together. yet, maybe this is  se of arimidex alone. first 2 months on arimidex were okay. want to quit arimidex."
127,128,so far so good for me   after last week's taxol.
128,129,she began treatment of 6 rounds of oxaliplatin and vectibix every 2 wks and xeloda 7 days on @ 3am and 2pm and 7 days off. she has stopped  xeloda.
129,130,"yesterday, my onctook meoff of arimidex and gave me a script foraromasin because of my severe joint pain. before arimidex, i took tamoxifen and   i couldn't stand that  -- buti   suffered more   on arimidex than tamoxifen."
130,131,
131,132,has anyone experienced edema with letrozole? it happened on tamoxifen - but that turned out to be blood clots.
132,133,"my husband is 28 years old and started tarceva (150mg) about 5 weeks ago - he already   reaped max benefits   from alimta & cisplatin (  50% shrinkage   of lung tumor and   everything else is stable or dead  ). his docs put him on metacycline (antibiotic) at  same time he started tarceva. they were expecting a horrid rash because he has a egfr level of 3+ (masses exhibit 3x more then average amount then  normal person), which is good because that's what tarceva goes after. also we know of someone whose lung tumor shrunk 90% on tarceva and she hasn't gotten a rash either. plus, i know many peoplewho got an awful rash and tarceva did nothing for them. he has some intermediate lung aching in his left lung since starting tarceva. his doctors seem to think this is a side-effect of tarceva and aren't worried."
133,134,jerseygirl - woohoo on boost #1 and so with you on  fence with arimidex and additional bone/joint pain - can't imagine what i have now being worse .
134,135,or could that be my first bout with  taxol i had on thursday ?
135,136,"need six rounds of tch (taxotere/carboplatin/herceptin), one every three weeks, with herceptin for a year. changed centers i'm having chemo at, same group, but one that is closer, so couldn't get appt until wednesday, which is one week and one day post chemo, for herceptin treatment."
136,137,"wallan, i think it could be a side effect of aromasin. if so, you may consider switching to femara and see how you do. i had extreme stomach/gas pains on arimidex and when i switched to femara  pain stopped. since your scans and bloodwork are normal i suspect  culprit may be aromasin or just stomach issues created by chemo."
137,138,"it began in march when i took ""vacation"" from arimidex. in april i returned to  arimidex."
138,139,i am on tamoxifen and i am also perimenopausal which can attribute to a lot of  symptoms. and of course  tamoxifen   wreaks havok on your joints and bones  .
139,140,"i also don't know how much taxol differs from taxotere (which i had first go round). and foolish as it might sound, losing my hair again (if taxol does this) would be devastating to me."
140,141,i have had 4 rounds of taxol.
141,142,
142,143,"dean15: i had some ankle swelling after round 1 from taxotere. oh yeah, and i have to do herceptin for a year, too. my eyes are all puffy (d*mn taxotere!"
143,144,trusting: i just finished 3 rounds of fec and started docetaxel on friday.
144,145,
145,146,i did have a very hard time with my hands and arimidex. i just started tamoxifen last sunday. both my med and radiation oncs think tamoxifen   is a really good drug   and  beneficial difference between  two is small - given my dx. i wish you (and all)  best and hope that arimidex does not wreak havoc on you as it did to me.
146,147,
147,148,"i do not notice an increase in joint pain when i get  aredia; however, since i have been on tamoxifen and more recently ais, i have had a huge increase in bone and joint pain."
148,149,i had taxol #1 and only had 1 bout of diarrhea but am wondering if it will happen every tx and more often?
149,150,"viddie, amera - yes i agree about chemo effects being accumulative - this taxotere   has really knocked me out  - tush rash, bladder infection, really tired. skye, how was your first herceptin? said he will do another one after chemo, before herceptin."
150,151,hi kosh:i get leg and hand swelling from  tamoxifen.
151,152,"i'm takingtamoxifen and onc told me to take vitamin e, which might help with hot flashes."
152,153,"tamoxifen can cause endometrial cancer and i took fertility drugs which raised my risk for ovarian, plus  lobular cancer i had can met to ovaries."
153,154,"what is your chemo regimen, cytoxan? adriamycin, taxotere?"
154,155,
155,156,
156,157,
157,158,suggestion for chemo was folfox plus avastin because she tolerated  oxi well  first time and   she had good response  . he is going to have her tumor sample ed for kras status to determine if erbitux is an option.
158,159,"lynda, i had taxotere, adriamycin and cytoxan, followed by neulasta. i also had headaches after my first treatment, but they slowed down  cytoxan drip for  second treatment and    headaches were much better  ."
159,160,i finished chemo 3 months ago and cant believe how almost normal i feel except some bone pain with  tamoxifen. i did femara when i was diagnosed stage 4 at  get go and   it worked for me for 2 1/2 years  . then  chemo train so i hope that faslodex keeps you in remission or stable for a long time so you can finally recover.
160,161,
161,162,
162,163,"bonnieva: maybe if you switch to weekly abaxane   it my help with side effects - they are more tolerable  . i have been on taxol and avastin weekly for5+ months,and   having minimal side effects  . i have read that avastin works better with abraxane. i was started on taxol and avastin. he will continue avastin and add an ai."
163,164,"i am 9 months post chemo, 4 rounds of ac followed by 12 rounds of taxol. for me,  lasting effects of  taxol have been brutal."
164,165,"i also worked through my treatment (taught online at first, then night classes when on taxol), and in hindsight, i am so grateful that i worked."
165,166,"hey palomino, i've been on taxol/avastin and now taxotere/avastin since may and i can tell you that   i have been doing very well on this combo   and i""ve had good success. i think most of my ses are from  taxol however."
166,167,"even though i tolerated ac   quite well  , weekly taxol   has been much easier  ."
167,168,
168,169,the neulasta shot is given 24-72 hours after  taxotere/cytoxan chemo.
169,170,
170,171,
171,172,"i am also questioning why  herceptin   didn't prevent  recurrence  , not to mention  famera."
172,173,taxol made my hands dry too and wrinkly looking.
173,174,
174,175,"i started xeloda two weeks ago -   so far okay  . i have some pain but dont know if its  cancer, zomenta, or xeloda?"
175,176,i   didn't feel it at all   when i was on herceptin only.
176,177,
177,178,and still very much dreading tamoxifen.
178,179,i took b6 & b12 when i had 8 months of taxotere & cytoxin.
179,180,
180,181,"hmmm, another gift from arimidex i had forgotten about."
181,182,avastin seems to still be   working for me  . i haven't yet tried erbitux.
182,183,"she said 60 gry was optimal for my situation but understands that i'm very concerned about: a) capsular contracture of  implant that's been in there since sept 2011; b) lymphadema since  surgery already took all  level one lymph nodes and she will be radiating all  level 2 & level 3 nodes; c) neuropathy since i still have some very serious problems 6 months after  taxotere chemo. i was a former long time smoker so i had a low-dose spiral ct done today to get a baseline of any prior damage to  lungs, since rads will damage at least a quadrant of  r lung. peaches - i had herceptin april thru september 2013, stopped for surgery & then had to stop because  2nd chemo (adriamycin) is also   very toxic to  heart  . just started herceptin again 2/5/14."
183,184,i have 2 more treatments of a/c then 8 weekly treatments of taxol/herceptin. maybe there isn't as much of a nadir with taxol? i haven't taken a look at  weekly taxol thread yet .
184,185,"i have been on tamoxifen, arimidex, faslodex and now aromasin. i have a real problem with nausea with these drugs (except for  faslodex which was a monthly injection) but  cancer returned last year to my lung, so i   guess that one didn't work very well  !."
185,186,
186,187,i was on tamoxifen when i progressed with bones mets from stage iii to iv. but in  9 months i've been on femara   i can't complain  . there is reason to hold onto hope that femara will do good things for you .
187,188,"i had 6 rounds of tac (taxotere or taxol - can't remember which, adriamycin, cytoxan) between june and sept of 2009."
188,189,
189,190,
190,191,i have one more treatment of ac next week and then i start taxol.
191,192,changlyn: i recently finished cytoxin with 5fu and epirubicin. i am now getting taxotere with herceptin.
192,193,i had thought it was all due to xeloda fatigue but turns out a significant amount was due to  celexa.
193,194,i admit my protein has slipped a lot my gut just can't digest  protein drinks and luckily my neuropathy with taxotere has gone away . i have read that taxol is   much worse for this though  .
194,195,about  tamoxifen i don't know as i won't be taking it.
195,196,"hi all, i haven't been on here in a while, i will bring you up to date, i am 44 years old, diagnosed with kc with mets to  lungs, have been on clinical trial with torisel,   did really well  , lung mets   shrunk 80% i was happy  , had my kidney removed 4 weeks ago, not as scary as i pictured it in my mind, but for past 15 weeks, have been complaining about my right side, just after biopsy of my kidney 15 weeks ago, i noticed a bump on my right side of my waist, right almost where you would bend to your right side, this area has given me lots of pain, i went to doctor's and was told it was an ""imflammation"" but  area kept getting worse and worse, i will take you back to when i had my biopsy,  man who did it took 5 needle biopsy's of my kidney, but on #4 he said to me, whoops, sorry, i missed, his missed caused me an intense amount of pain, but not knowing any different i sucked up  pain and never thought about it again until a short while ago, getting back to my right side, i had ultrasounds done, everyone still kept saying imflammation, then as i said weeks ago, i am in hospital to get my kidney removed then after surgery i hear from my doctor that my right side is a tumor that is wrapped around my nerves and that is  1st time i hear  word ""seeding"" being used regarding me, scary, i thought that it was 100% not a chance, never happened in 50 - 60 years, modern medicine it just doesn't happen, right??? pls, i am now back on treatments of torisel, they tell me that now  kidney is gone they hope  rest of  tumors will dissolve since there is not  main one left to feed  little ones, so now i think i should only have  lung mets to fight that should be it, so why do i have these other things, can someone please answer me."
196,197,"harley, i mentioned  lexapro and tamoxifin mix to my onc."
197,198,
198,199,
199,200,"just thought i would check in and see how everyone is doing and also because i wish i could go back on tamoxifen! but since being diagnosed with a met on my femur (at  hip)  mo has asked me to try anastrozole (arimidex). with tamoxifen i   had lots of side effects but somehow i found them manageable  . on tamoxifen i had headaches (but not as bad as now), blurred vision, hearing loss, excess fluid (sinuses & ears), hands, feet and leg pain. after just a few weeks on anastrozole i started feeling  bone pain, headaches and hot flashes. maybe this will just be an adjustment time for me and then it will level off like  tamoxifen did? anyway wishing you all success with your tamoxifen tolerance and lessoning side effects!"
200,201,"i had lumpectomy and rads and tamoxifen, 9 years ago, they missed an itty bitty spot, apparently, and got it back."
201,202,"i had three rounds of taxotere, carbo and herceptin. told me my only choices were two trials, one of which is a tdm-1 trial in which i could get either tdm-1 or tykerb/xeloda. offhandedly,  research nurse helping me with  trial told me on  day i started (on xeloda/tykerb) that there was nothing new on my ct scan of my liver. and i really wanted to get off  xeloda/tykerb because i hated  side effects. minton, her nurse calls, urgently, and says get off  xeloda/tykerb, immediately - - -we're putting you back on tch. she wants two more rounds of tch to ""seal  deal"", then i am on to herceptin every 3 weeks and a hormonal (tamoxifen, perhaps, or depending on  status of my chemopause/ovaries, femara)."
202,203,"i get to have a pet scan in 2 weeks, before  taxotere,that should be fun."
203,204,taxotere   kills hair permanently  .
204,205,"glenna, i do take benadryl but not during treatment. i'm ready with my spread sheet, reasoning on why they should treat me with cytoxan and faslodex."
205,206,hair loss and some muscle pain on taxol.
206,207,
207,208,
208,209,"i'm on tamoxifen now, and have lots of aches and pains, which is a se, but i'm here."
209,210,
210,211,"kim - on  thetaxotere toes. i really think that  taxotere   did a number on my legs and feet   :( it is not too bad now but i do have extreme sensitivity to heat and cold which makes pedicures painful, hot showers out of  question and dipping my feet in  cold water after a long hot hike a little daunting."
211,212,"i just got diagnosed with ""taxotere associated alopecia"" yesterday."
212,213,
213,214,"taxol, only?"
214,215,
215,216,rememebr that  tamoxifen is helping you to stay cancer free. i was emotional but i think it was  stress of  radiation more than tamoxifen.
216,217,i did have  allergic reaction to  taxotere. they gave me more benedryl and restarted  taxotere which i was able to finish. for others who have had  taxotere allergy reaction - did it happen every time after  first time you had it?
217,218,"i didn't put weight on   with tamoxifen or not much anyway, but have put it on with my latest treatment :(yep, it would be nice if none of this happened to any of us."
218,219,"ladies on tamoxifen have to avoid most of these due to metabolism competition but should be no problem with letrozole. many of us find effexor/venlaxafine beneficial in minimizing hot flashes - you could ask your doctor about that one also even if ""warm flushes"" weren't bothering you too much. best remedy i've found for coping with side effects  from my aromatase inhibitor during  past month is exercise."
219,220,"i had my second taxotere treatment today. so go  look then call  doc, i was am taking claritin for  bone pain from  shot but they said it might help with  taxotere also."
220,221,"was diagnosed with mets last february,   failed   on xeloda and tykerb. switched to iv chemo abraxane and carboplatin and i got  results of my cea today."
221,222,i am only 3/12 taxol.
222,223,"my body is screaming   from  abraxane. i gave  beast radiation, adriamycin, cytoxan, methotrexate, 5-fu, and abraxane."
223,224,i posted this in  jan chemo forum also but you ladies have been on  taxols longer or donei noticed last evening when i was sitting next to someone at a dinner that my finger nails are very pearly pink colored. another taxol down today (#10).
224,225,
225,226,"i then used irinotecan (camptosar or cpt-11) for my systemic chemotherapy and then had fudr going through my pump. when i signed up, i could have gone to mayo, their part of  study used oxilaplatin instead of irinotecan as  systemic chemo. currently on treatment 11 of folofox6 / avastin."
226,227,
227,228,"about  iud, for what it's worth, i was having horrible, frequent periods (peri-menopausal) with tons of breast pain and bloating prior to my diagnosis, but tamoxifen has actually   made all of that much better, with very few annoying side effects   (minor hair loss, occasional hot flushes, and occasional leg cramps, but   none frequent or severe enough to be a real problem  )."
228,229,how long since your last taxol? i'm was onlytaking 1 prilosec which i continued after  taxol.
229,230,i started arimedex at 53.
230,231,"se's of taxol are   brutal  ! i'm on weekly taxol and only have 5 out of  way so far. completely, utterly unable to move with taxol. i've had a cough since january that they can't get rid of and i think i finally pulled a muscle, aggrivated by neupogen and general taxol muscle pain, and now i can barely move."
231,232,
232,233,"taxol was not yet routinely given, although shortly it would be. it was rough for me and i would probably not have done  taxol even if it was offered."
233,234,"finished tc in may '09, finished herceptin in dec. had hot flashes all last summer until i stopped tamoxifen temporarily (onco said i didn't need it if my periods had stopped) but took progesterone cream and that   helped   hot flashes to stop as well. periods began back again march, april and may so am back on tamoxifen, especially since my remaining breast was so tender i could't stand  pain. no more hot flashes now and haven't notcied any s. es either this go around with  tamox  (but i am still doing  progesterone cream so maybe that is off setting any potential hot flashes). i continued with  drippy nose until i was off herceptin completely for about 6 weeks. i also noticed my hair really took off growing after i finished herceptin, even though they say that has nothing to do with it."
234,235,"don was put on sutent following a right liver lobe embolozation procedure done at mayoto make  healthy left liver lobe grow big enough to take over  liver workload, with  surgical plan being to resect  right liver lobe. surgeon up there told our oncologist that if that liver tumor can be shrunk enough, and no spread elsewhere, and  lung tumors (now only 2, down from 6, thanks to lots of prayers, a great oncologistand sutent), can be eradicated or at least stabilized, he will be willing to reconsider a liver resection for don. even if it didn't seem so at  time, i suspect your blessing was that you got  sutent up front of  removal of  kidney and adrenal gland."
235,236,"did dd a/c, taxol & a year of herceptin. due to  number of nodules & size of  goiter, when i was nearly done  herceptin, i had a total thyroidectomy."
236,237,
237,238,"i had 12 more taxol treatments so it kept thinning, i wanted to do dose dense taxol (8 stronger doses rather then 12 lighter doses) i would have had a lot more hair when done!!"
238,239,
239,240,
240,241,"i wait until they start  taxol, get out  beach towels, bury my hands and nails in one gel pack, rest my feet on another and place another on top of  toenails. they stay cold for  hour  taxol infuses."
241,242,"i found soltamox (a liquid form) after hours of online researching and asked my mo if i could try that. soltamox is imported from  uk. soltamox may be back in production. my main ses from both  mylan and soltamox has been brain fog, short term memory loss, pelvic cramps and pain, and muscle cramps. but  fillers are different in all three meds - watson, mylan, and soltamox"
242,243,i'm on tamoxifen since just before christmas.
243,244,"i've been on aromasin for 3 months and have a pill for all  side effects :( ativan for insomnia gabapentin for night sweats prevacid for heart burn (this se was  worst for me and scared  heck out of me as my worst mets are in  stomach) thanks, lobular."
244,245,"hi tabatha, i had 4 ac and then 12 weekly taxols. for me  acwas much worse than  taxol. after my first several taxol treatments   i felt really good  . best part of taxol, is that   my hair grew  entire time  ."
245,246,"almost a whole week after taxotere, i have  vivid feeling of eating paper. on  hair, after my 2nd taxotere, my   hair seems to be growing back  ."
246,247,i had my first taxol yesterday. if there is no reaction for 3 weeks they will move to me taking  pre meds orally before chemo and only take an hour to administer  taxol- rather than  3 hours it took yesterday.
247,248,"i had my first on 4/21 and i go back every 3 weeks (3 more rounds of a-c, then 4 rounds of taxotere/carboplatin)."
248,249,"i am in my 5th month of weekly taxol (3 weeks on, one week off). taxol is cumulative and builds up. i've got 5 more treatments to go, then hopefully will get a break and just be on herceptin until progression again."
249,250,"i go for weekly herceptin today, next week will be tx#5. emotions are really wacky and  taxotere   makes me look like i am crying all  time  ."
250,251,"definitely, make certain to at least get a bone density scan just prior to starting femara, and ask for one on an an annual basis thereafter. unfortunately,cannot be going back on femara. femara is known tocause bone loss in users. femara.com website states this right from  onset, look for yourself :) i did not really understand  numbers behind theresults of  original study:http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp? l2=2&l3=6&sid=130&cid=1393&pid=0&catid=02383women were put into  trial.1579 took femara, 804 did not.2% (31) of  1579 women taking letrozole had a recurrence compared with 4.9% (39) of  804 women who chose to not take  drug. women who were ""randomly"" assigned initially got to choose whether they wanted to start taking femara, or take  placebo - this means that these results don't come from a randomized trial. a higher percentage ofwomen who chose to not start taking femara also didn't have chemotherapy, which could have been a factor in their local and distant recurrence rates. but out of2383 women, 31 of  femara takers got a recurrence, vs. 39 recurrence in thosethat did not take femara. it is easy to be persuaded by others when they toss around a number such as, ""well, if you take femara, you have a 60% less chance of recurrence."". my grudge is that my onc should have have a bone density scan done at one year post starting femara (see femara website for their recommendation). having understood  femara test results, and being aware of thechance of getting osteoporisis would havealerted me to pushing my onc. for a bone density test one year after starting (just to make sure my body was handling  femara okay). if  loss was appreciable at one year, my onc and iwould have talked aboutchoosing to stay on femara and hoping it did not worsen, or perhaps look at altenatives such as putting me on tamoxifen (while maybe not as effective as femara, tamox is still   beneficial to post menopausal women, without such high of a risk for bone loss  ). you both are new to femara, so you have a chance to monitor itseffect on your bones. and get 2 rib fractures, just 22 months after taking femara. change of -1.8 down to -4.9 after 22 months on femara is a phenomenal amount (words my doc used). you willlikely not realize bone loss after only a handful of months on femara. i have to stop  femara, i have no choice. maybe tamoxifen. but, general consensus is that this is a direct cause of femara. :(i wonder if  femara/zometa trial is attempting to acertain if  zometa can aid in  bone loss femara users experience? white/caucasian women who are small boned are particularly suseptible to bone loss on femara (something else i did not know."
251,252,taxotere part was a little harder--to me--kind of like having  flu with aches/pains.
252,253,"i had  pains too on arimidex, getting up and moving around a bit   helped  ."
253,254,also talk of weekly taxol instead of every two weeks. weekly taxol is a 12 week treatment versus  4 treatments every other week.
254,255,
255,256,"there are no budgetary contraints on getting femara or what have you immediately they are needed. my op was june 24th, i had a bad infection, i am better now and just completed my first chemo last week (fec, of i think usually called cef in  us) in between times i went onto femara   which was ok  ."
256,257,"on a positive note, i started tamoxifen last week and   so far, knock wood, i have had zero side effects  !"
257,258,june 5th and 26th and then arimidex for5 years.
258,259,after 6 months of a/c and taxol i had a short period off before my surgery.
259,260,i also take an advil in  morning since it   works   with inflammation & helps with  hormonal aches & pains from femara.
260,261,"i have been on lupron and exemestane  since january 2012. had 1tc and 5 cmf (had reaction to taxetere) because path report showed some lyphatic-vascular invasion, then 37 external radiation tx. first month on lupron/exemestane had terrrible depression, days of crying non-stop, hot flashes, joint pain."
261,262,
262,263,
263,264,i was also a   minimal-se   chemo girl - i had treatments in south florida while i was commuting to dc - and had 33 radiation treatments (also bilateral) and have been taking femara (after a brief round of tamoxifen) since early 2007.
264,265,
265,266,my eye doc said it was tamoxifen toxicity. tamoxifen had caused two ovarian cysts.
266,267,"as you've seen lately,  future of bexxar and zevalin are at great risk because of a cms ruling. feel free to write whatever you wish, and if you aren?t certain what to write, simply copy and paste  following: i respectfully request an immediate reversal of cms-1392-fc as it relates to bexxar and zevalin. zevalin september 2002."

268,269,
269,270,"i had these after chemo, radiation and 2 years tamoxifen which really affected my uterus."
270,271,"beach, i was also afraid of scarring from  taxotere ""burns"" on my face and hands but thankfully that didn't happen. i finished 12 treatments of taxotere in april, and  skin on my face is still super dry. only other side effect was  taxotere did a number on my nails -- they are falling off for a 2nd time."
271,272,i've just started tamoxifen and i've heard sometimes it affects hair growth so will see if that has an impact.
272,273,
273,274,i was pre-meno at dx and could not take tamoxifen--so i had to go on lupron shots monthly and letrozole. i had been toying with going off letrozole--- i still have about 1.5 years on it--- but   so far bones are fine  --  main issue for me is vaginal dryness and lack of libido.
274,275,"lisa - yeast infections - that's somethign that i've not heard for tamox use - i really think you should follow up with gyn about that just in case it's based on something else. jsut about all other psots are things i've had or heard of on tamox, unfortunately! (yes, i choose that option over  one that says my memory cells are fried from tamoxifen and/or chemo!!!) and it's so hard to know what is tamox and what is regular menopause. important in case it wasn't mentioned many times before - it's crucial to see gyn every 6 mos while on tamox to monitor uterine and cervical changes carefully."
275,276,"4 rounds of ac and 4 rounds of ixempra. i'm a bit leary of  ixempra, but it is cutting my treatments in half, so i was willing to try."
276,277,
277,278,"i had a longer than normal course of chemo in 2012 - ac dd, taxol dd, carboplatin (6 months). taxol caused my neuropathy - carboplatin exacerbated."
278,279,)paula - hope your counts are up and you are able to do  taxol. tamoxifen -  mo i saw last week wrote  prescription for this.
279,280,"hi nanda, i really feel for you as i had  same experience on taxotere, my  toe nails and finger nails just looked so bad  , i couldn't find anything to help  regrowth and it took about 6 months for them to look 'normal', i wish there was something i could tell you worked a treat but it was only time that made them look any better, at times i used to cover myfinger nails withbandaids."
280,281,
281,282,
282,283,i took avastin for 6 months with no preload of any other drug. avastin side effects can vary it can cause high blood pressure which can be controlled by medicine. all in all avastin is an   easy drug to tolerate  . i also was on abraxane for 6 months and only had aloxi as my preload drug for anti nausea. i believe benadryl is given to some for abraxane allergy.
283,284,some nerve cells damaged by drugs like taxol and taxotere take longer to repair/replace.
284,285,
285,286,"my first 4 rounds were taxotere & cisplatin, then 4 rounds of adriamycin & cytoxan. i had a allergic reaction to  adriamycin so they had to premedicate me before administating it."
286,287,
287,288,"after  lumpectomy, my oncologist recommended going on  tamoxifen regimen because of other high risk factors, but told me i'd have to get off prozac. tomorrow i go back to  oncologist to start  tamoxifen."
288,289,"i am on abraxane which is a ""cousin"" to taxol. i really think you will have  same with taxol ."
289,290,i had a hard time with taxotere i think i was given strong doses and even though i complained my doctor only lower a little at  last one.
290,291,"as for  tamoxifen, unfortunately it was not good for me. i went on femara and  bone pain was intolerable so i went on arimidex and   it has been somewhat better  ."
291,292,"you might get some sort of odd ball side effects from  taxotere, mostly  blackening of nails,   but no biggie  ."
292,293,"would a estradiol level (normal lab, not sensitive test) of 19.4 be a reason to go from femara to fulvestrant? i am actually thinking it might be  femara or fosamax, actually i am now on  generic which is a bit more with bone pain, especially at night and in my feet of all places."
293,294,i had abraxane alone (same as taxol but no steroids) last wedesday.
294,295,
295,296,i started taking tamoxifen a few weeks ago and   have not noticed any particular side effects from that  .
296,297,i finished a/c end of aug and started weekly taxol mid sep. my hair fell out with a/c and  taxol is keeping it out. will be taking taxol into dec and finishing into next sep with  herceptin.
297,298,i've had headaches with both ac and taxol. has anyone experienced soreness under fingernails  day after taxol treatment?
298,299,"protocol was cisplatin/vp16, 3 days-on, 3 weeks-off for 3 months. protocol was changed in feb 2003 to taxotere/gemzar, 1 day-on, every other week. he gave her a few options: 1-iressa, 2-possible clinical trials with experimental drugs or 3-to do nothing."
299,300,
300,301,"i felt great for 3 months after all  treatments   then fatigue set in,  i found out my thyroid was on  blink so started meds for it,  i have tried all  inhibitors and was finally put on femara in march. i took tamoxifen for 6 months but quick taking it to see if it was causing  fatigue,  it wasn't so started taking it again,  then i had a tia a small mini storke so had to go off  tamoxifen,  that is why i am now on  femara,  i can't tell if it is adding to my fatigue because it hasn't change,  i am still miserable!"
301,302,"then you could decide about  tamoxifen, or try it and   see if you do ok."
302,303,it started growing slowly but steadily with taxol. i started taxol in june so what hair i have now is about 6 months worth.
303,304,
304,305,"anyway, they were back down yesterday and i had my second taxol, but they are talking about putting me back to three weekly for  last two as i do seem to have a bad reaction to it. i cannot imagine how it must be getting taxol every week kathleen."
305,306,"sammy kay and alyson, you're not alone with  ongoing ses of t (even though mine was taxotere and i finished may 24th)."
306,307,this taxotere isn't exactly a gentle agent.
307,308,"zzlady i'm on weekly taxol first (then ac). i was great until about week 4 then i started having one bad day a week (i got taxol on monday and thursdays are bad). my   symptoms are very low   (tiny bit of neuropothy in feet only, mouth feels like i burned it but no sores, any non-grey hair has fallen out [i shaved  rest]) there is a weekly taxol group on here i'd suggest you join."
308,309,i have been on tamoxifen only since february. i would not want to go on antidepressants but recognise i need some help so i am having a course of aromatherapy with reflexology and massage and have been given a aroma smell stick to assist with my symptoms which may be  menopause or side effect of tamoxifen its hard to know which.
309,310,"hi ladies, is anyone else being given mitoxantrone and cytoxan?"
310,311,
311,312,"mine started to come back   even though i am still doing weekly taxol(last one on tuesday), but it's all white - snort."
312,313,"they looked at  dosages i was given last time and think it was too much, so they just gave me herceptin today and said next week i should have rebounded and can get  taxol and carboplatin again, but this time at a lower dose. as  oncology np said, it's  herceptin we most want you to have, and you can certainly have that."
313,314,
314,315,next up is taxol and i've been checking everyone's posts to see just how bad it's going to be.
315,316,started just a little over a week after i began taking tamoxifen.
316,317,"i have finished ac and am 1/2 way through my 4 taxol. with  taxol,   i've got my tastebuds back  . it is an awesome list of tips and must haves.~adrienne"
317,318,i   did not get my hair back   after taxotere.
318,319,"i'm honestly not sure if i would continue without maybe getting a second opinion and finding out if you have any other options, like substituting taxol or maybe abraxane, which is what's sometimes done for when someone has an allergic reaction to taxotere."
319,320,"hello everyone -i start 12 doses of taxol next week - it was supposed to be this week, but i had such a   horrible time   with ac that i needed to take a week off to regain my strength. i hope that taxol will be easier on me, and in reading all of  posts here, i see that maybe they will and maybe they won't! thanks so much for writing down everything that you already have - i have a notepad next to me with lots of product ideas that could help me get through  taxol experience!"
320,321,"last 3 months i was on taxol/herceptin,   felt much better   until  neuropathy set in my toes and heels."
321,322,"i had taxol 8 years ago and had an allergic reaction to it, but i did finish 4 treatments anyway. now i have a new primary and  doc wanted to do taxol again and i asked about abraxane, as this is what my first opinion had suggested. i have finished 6 of 12 weekly abraxane now and    side effects for me have been much less   than what i had on taxol, although with each treatment it is getting a bit worse. i do not have as much weakness or fatique on abraxane and actually    first 4 treatments i felt really good  . (i did 6 ac every 2 weeks before  abraxane). i also am doing avastin every 3 weeks with  abraxane and zometa every 4 weeks."
322,323,
323,324,i just did my fourth round of taxol and 2 round of carbo.
324,325,"plus i googled taxotere rash and found others who have had similar rashes. nurse practitioner suggested benadryl, aveeno bath, aveeno lotion ."
325,326,"i had  same reaction to  taxol; as before mentioned,  hair held on for  first 4 treatments, then was coming out in clumps. subsequently, i had nosebleeds during  treatment, but they stopped after  taxol treatment, too. herceptin each week to finish out  year will be easy & well-tolerated by you."
326,327,but i was glad i waited as  taxotere   was hell on my body   and i could not imagine having  pain of expanders while i had (have)  pain from taxotere.
327,328,
328,329,  i have been feeling increasingly depressed   on tamoxifen for  past two weeks. my onc really wants me to stay on tamox but agreed to a little break and put me on remaron.
329,330,couldn't give me any clearcut answer as to why tamoxifen would be beneficial and actually stated she didn't know what she'd do in my shoes. agreed that taking tamoxifen is to risky for me (i had a stroke 13 years ago) but that radiation would zap any cancer cells that may be lurking--especially on/near  incision.
330,331,"carol, please don't count yourself out of receiving avastin, there are people who do not receive se that appear evident. i had many symptoms of avastin and received  placebo so it can go both ways. your taste buds might still be affected while receiving taxol, have to wait and see so hang in there. what days will you be getting your taxol shot? with taxol  fatigue remained along with finger/toe nail discoloration, infectionand detachment. neuropathy is a common se with taxol; however,  three of us   did not get any symptoms  , getting  drug weekly may be making thedifference."
331,332,i finished radiation in december of last year and went on tamoxifen in january 2010.
332,333,aromasin had been a nonevent up and until  bone scan report.
333,334,"having been on tamox for a year now with   almost no se  , i didn't notice any difference - if anything my hot flushes have been less frequent. i need to compare se carefully, tamox for me   is easy   and if it works just as well - why change?"
334,335,"update: well aromasin was worse of all  meds ive taken. went to see my onc after being on  aromasin for 1month. can you believe he switched me back to tamoxifen. been on tamoxifen for about 2wks now,   doing much better, no more migraines, nausea  , still some joint/bone pain of course, but according to my docs just take baby aspirin and thats all they can say about  pains which sucks since im in a position right now that i have to start looking for a job b4 unemployment runs out."
335,336,"i did get my taxol today after all. however, last night i started steroids in preparation for my taxol today, and this morning all  swelling was gone, and i had no pain. he wasn't going to give me taxol if it showed any signs of infection, although my blood work was fine."
336,337,
337,338,lociti - are you doing weekly or dose dense taxol?
338,339,"hello to everyone, this board has been  most helpfull resource i've found :-) i too started taxotere and cytoxin on  16th."
339,340,"so glad  taxol is doing its job! as for taxotere, every taxotere treatment seems to be getting worse for me."
340,341,"regarding  current chemotherapy that she is on, nexavar & alimta, he said that if  side effects were not too bad and if he thought that they even might be working a little bit that he would continue on them. but, since  side effects from both nexavar and alimta are rather severe, and since they do not appear to be working, that we should stop treatment (at least with this combo)."
341,342,"i had 8 doses of 5 fu, luekovorin, oxaliplatin and avastin. had some complications with  oxaliplatin, but   tolorated it very well  . and yes, i took 5fu in  folfox regimen, combined with avastin."
342,343,"adriamycin is   hard on your system including liver  . joansf had just completed 12 rounds of taxotere; i inherited my caps from her, and i can tell you she had a full head of gorgeous hair."
343,344,
344,345,i had4 rounds of ac and just had my 8th treatmentout of 12 weekly taxol treatments today. worst thing i have experiencedwith taxol is a littlemuscle/bonepain and a little fatigue.
345,346,i have been on anastrazole since july.
346,347,
347,348,
348,349,it sounds like your heart failure is from  adriamycin and not  herceptin. cardiologist attributes my heart damage which was in  left ventricle to  adriamycin. you just need to make sure they monitor your heart function regularly if they start you back on herceptin. i didn't do herceptin because when i was dx'd back in 2001 it was only offered for stage 4.
349,350,i took 400 mg nightly while i was on a year of weekly taxol and   never developed neuropathy  .
350,351,"stephanie - caroline is right, fatigue is a definite se of tamoxifen. if you're curoius, here's  complete list of se that breast cancer.org provides:http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/tamoxifen.jspside effects of tamoxifentamoxifen's selective estrogen activation effects can cause some serious side effects, including blood clots, stroke, and endometrial cancer. if you and your doctor are considering tamoxifen as part of your treatment plan, tell your doctor if you smoke or have a history of blood clots or heart attack. if you're taking tamoxifen, call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms:the most common side effects of tamoxifen are:here's an odd question for  rest of you - has anyone noticed that their night sweats are triggered by specific foods ?"
351,352,":d after my taxol treatment i   was really red for  next two days   -- i assumed it was because of all  ""extra"" steroids -  24 hours of decadron, etc. for taxol : i found this article on foods to eat to enhance taxol and what to avoid (the avoidance list is small.)"
352,353,menapause as soon as i started tamoxifen. i was on tamoxifen for 5 years then many mos. of femara then many months of aromasin.
353,354,"welcome jgallo, i am doing  weekly taxol/herceptin for 12 weeks and then herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. so then we decided on  taxol/herceptin. so i have 4 treatments left and then herceptin for a year. i think tamoxifin."
354,355,
355,356,they came back quite nice for a while then anastrozole thinned them out.
356,357,
357,358,"i've been on anastrazol for about a year, with   no ses   (other than some initial bone aches, quickly resolved by a daily claritin (regular, not claritin-d))."
358,359,
359,360,"that includes toenails because of  taxotere's supposed effects as combined with uv light. i'm not sure if it's just taxotere or all  ""tax"" prefixed drugs."
360,361,while on tamoxifen i had hormone level blood tests (recommend! tamoxifen sometimes tricks  body into thinking that it's running low on estrogen so it kicks up production.
361,362,i don't have my next taxol until sept. 1st. he changed me to three weeks when he put me on taxol. he said it would be harder on me than  taxotere.
362,363,chemo # 3 was thursday and after  first 2 days (which were moderately good) neulasta & taxotere really kicked my butt!!!
363,364,it was   rough physically   but this 12 weeks of taxol/hercepin   is killing me  . has anyone else had this reaction to taxol or herceptin.
364,365,
365,366,"so, with  taxotere,  i've found them to be  pretty rough  ."
366,367,"i took neupogen a couple times when i was on taxol, but only for a couple days. i was very fatigued about  3rd - 6th day after chemo, especially when i was on adriamycin and cytoxan."
367,368,"i had my chemo in  following order: taxotere, then cytoxan and then  herceptin infusion was last. once i knew  infusion nurse was about to start  taxotere, i would go to  restroom and made sure i had a large cup of ice water and a cup of ice to consume during  infusion. if you ice, you won't be able to get up during thetaxotere to go to  restroom. about 15 minutes before  taxotere infusion, i iced myfingernails and toe nails and continue to ice during  hourtaxotere ran and for 15 minutes after  infusion ( total icingtime 1 1/2 hours. )for  first time of receiving taxotere,  taxotere is run much slower so  infusion staff can see how you will react to  taxotere. you may receive benedryl in your iv with your pre-chemo drugs to help with any reactions you may have with  taxotere. just remember that you will not be left alone once you actually start receiving  taxotere. once that is finished, i usually took a restroom break before  cytoxan was run. cytoxan may also be run a little slower  first time. i usually continued to drink water/eat ice during  cytoxan infusion. fyi: if you are hooked up to a portable iv pole, you can get up during  cytoxan and walk around. cytoxan usually ran for 30-45 minutes after  first round. then, it was herceptin time for me. it was run over an hour to watch for reaction to  herceptin. i am now having herceptin infusions only and those will continue to be run over an hour's time."
368,369,
369,370,i am back at work today after my 4th taxol treatment and i   feel fine  . i started taxol weekly x12 on jan. 7. i dont do  herceptin so maybe that is  difference.
370,371,tamoxifen i started 4 weeks after last chemo.
371,372,
372,373,i have been constipated for about 9 months anyway due to navelbine and gemzar. i actually had little tubes put in my eyes to correct that after i did abraxane.
373,374,"linda, i've been having almost daily headaches too, ever since shortly after starting anastrazole, and that's not normal for me at all. i couldn't tolerate tamoxifen, so far anastrazole is   not as bad  , so i will hang in there until i can't, and then try something else."
374,375,i took for aboutfive months starting  day of  first taxol infusion.
375,376,
376,377,i really struggled with  arimidex issue.
377,378,"i have been on weekly abraxane/avastin on thursdays for  past 6 months (started weekly then switched to  3 weeks on 1 week off routine). my onc talked about me staying on for a year or more, but my cancer has been knocked back enough that i can transition to femara soon, so i think it all depends on how things look."
378,379,"i exercise daily and as a her2 positive stage 1 cancer patient 11 years out from treatment with just cafx6, imrt rads, and 1 3/4 yrs of tamoxifen (no ai, no taxane, and no trastuzumab), i take 250 mg of metformin with every meal."
379,380,"(j cardiovasc pharmacol (2005): modulation by melatonin of  cardiotoxic and antitumor activities of adriamycin) have shown that given melatonin's oncolytic activity,  combination of adriamycin and melatonin   improved  antitumor activity   of adriamycin, as   indicated by an increase in  number of long-term survivors as well as decreases in body-weight losses   resulting from adriamycin treatment, suggesting that melatonin not only   protects   against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity but also   enhances its antitumor activity   and further suggesting that a melatonin and adriamycin combination represents a   potentially useful  regimen for  treatment of human neoplasms, by virtue of  fact that it allows  use of lower doses of adriamycin, thereby avoiding  toxic side effects associated with this drug  . j pineal res (2005): melatonin modulates aromatase activity in mcf-7 human breast cancer cells) have demonstrated that melatonin, at physiological concentrations,   decreases aromatase activity and expression  in mcf-7 cells, and that this aromatase inhibitory effect of melatonin, together with its already known antiestrogenic properties interacting with  estrogen-receptor,strongly suggests a role in  prevention and treatment of hormone-dependent mammary neoplasias;   see also  study of cos et al. (int j cancer (2005): melatonin   inhibits  growth of dmba-induced mammary tumors  by decreasing  local biosynthesis of estrogens through  modulation of aromatase activity) , which investigated  in vivo aromatase-inhibitory properties of melatonin, noting that melatonin   inhibits  growth of breast cancer cells   by interacting with estrogen-responsive pathways, thus behaving as an antiestrogenic hormone, and concluding from their in vivo study that melatonin could exert its   antitumoral effects   on hormone-dependent mammary tumors by   inhibiting  aromatase activity of  tumoral tissue  , and phase ii studies report an increase of objective responses  in cancer patients using melatonin. (breast cancer res treat (2005): melatonin   enhances  inhibitory effect of aminoglutethimide on aromatase activity  in mcf-7  human breast cancer cells), melatonin may be a novel means to   increase  efficacy   of competitive aromatase inhibitors used in treating breast cancer. melatonin as a serm, aromatase inhibitor, and anti-estrogen melatonin demonstrates an an oncostatic role on hormone-dependent mammary tumors, interacting with estrogen-signaling pathways via three antiestrogenic mechanisms: (1) acting through  estrogen receptor to interfere with  effects of endogenous estrogens (in keeping with selective estrogen receptor modulator (serm) activity); and (2) interfering with estrogen synthesis by inhibiting  enzymes that control  interconversion from their androgenic precursors (in keeping with anti-aromatase / inhibitory activity);. ), melatonin: biological basis of its function in health and disease (landes bioscience (2005)) who observe that fresh tumors aresensed by  pineal gland via neuroimmunoendocrine changes, leading to a stimulation of melatonin secretion which in turn activates endogenous defense processes, and they further document  mobilization of endogenous defense mechanisms against malignant processes by melatonin, thus improving survival, suggesting that melatonin via indirect systemic mechanisms is able to favorable affect even advanced forms of malignancy, although a caution is that melatonin also exerts stimulatory effects on  hematopoietic system, thus potential aggravating a bone marrow cancer like leukemia."
380,381,i had ac x4 biweekly (dose dense) followed by taxol x4 biweekly. adriamycin was a few large syringes pushed one right after  other. cytoxin was a slow drip over about 90-120 minutes.
381,382,well today i had 5/6 taxotere.
382,383,i really do not want her starting my taxol.
383,384,
384,385,
385,386,"i felt so ancient on  20mgs and after reading all  low dose tamoxifen articles, decided to switch to 10mgs. basically, all  articles suggest   lower doses can offer  some of  same benefits   -- there is a minimum threshold at which  tamoxifen will work and anything extra just floats around your body. problem is, they don't know what that minimum threshold is -- so they give tamoxifen to everyone at  same dose."
386,387,carla - now there's a thought - clothes swapping since tamoxifen   screws with our metabolism and weight  !
387,388,

389,390,in fact   i felt better right out   of a/c + taxotere than i did a year later on femara.
390,391,
391,392,"maybe it's  taxol -- i'm only 1 week post first taxol infusion and already    eczema spots on my feet have almost disappeared  . taxol, for me, seems to have brought with it restless leg syndrome."
392,393,im on taxotere carboplatin herceptin. taxotere will make her hair fall out.
393,394,round 2 was yesterday and as i thought they took me off taxotere. it seems  colon issues can be a more uncommon side effect of taxotere. mo switched to adriamycin with  cytoxan every 2 weeks instead of three but still same number of 4 rounds total. question- i see several of you on ac will follow on taxol.
394,395,
395,396,and i will be getting taxol in 2 weeks for 4 txs. kaye- i have 4 taxol treatments to go.
396,397,i've finished 6 taxol with herceptin every 3 weeks. i still have  numbness and my hips still are stiff/sore since  taxol.
397,398,"my first herceptin   wasnt to bad  , just a long day! my last taxol is  3rd. then its just herceptin for 18 mo."
398,399,
399,400,only 7 more taxol's to go!!!
400,401,"anyway, i started tamoxifen two weeks ago, two weeks after rads were over. so far i haven't noticed any new side effects with  tamoxifen."
401,402,
402,403,hi windlass - i fasted during taxotere x3 and did not have  diarrhea that can bother many patients. i understand your fear about taxotere neuropathy and would do anything to avoid it.
403,404,"tamoxifen   didn't help me  .?? i tried  lumpectomy, 34 rads and tamoxifen.?? good luck and   don't rely   on tamoxifen if you are ilc."
404,405,"i go in for #2 taxol tomorrow. for me taxol fatigue seems to make me sleep more instead of just feeling tired. bad news  taxol is interfering with my wafarin dosage, which they need to find a new dosage that works today my inr was high where they need to take me off for 3 days to drive  # down into  therapeutic range of 2-3. with taxol i still can't taste, but  really odd thing i am forgetting to eat like i am just not hunger."
405,406,
406,407,omg i'm in  same boat but with taxotere after my bilateral mastectomy it was 4 weeks that i started my first dose and it was awful.
407,408,

410,411,"i'm 43, been on tamoxifen for almost 4 months. hot flashes during chemo, and continued hot flashes when i started tamoxifen. i've been reading that it's easy to gain weight on tamoxifen. i've been going to  bathroomat least 4 times a night, which i'm not sure if it's because i'vebeen drinking a lot of water, or because of  chemo or tamoxifen?"

413,414,
414,415,i found that i had some nausea and maybe a bit more tired but that could just be cumulative effect (after 12x taxol).
415,416,"after a year on arimidex, i had horrific trigger finger (middle finger) and trigger thumb on my right hand. i quit  arimidex, and in 8 weeks, all my ses (i had a huge long list) went away. then i started femara. i stopped  femara a month ago."
416,417,"i flunked tamoxifen after two months on it (became extremely weak, had to use a wheelchair--very alarming). i finished five years of arimedex in april of this year (dryness of just about everything, very little joint aches, maybe some tiredness but i can't be sure because i was always on them since bc treatment so maybe i'm just weaker than i was --   but othewise no particular problems)  . then in april my onc started me on femara, and   i was glad for  added protection  . wish i could just go on with  arimidex --   it was easier  ."
417,418,i cycled through 6 dose dense rounds ofboth ac and taxol and have to say that taxol was much easier.
418,419,"i will start on feb 6 with  carboplatins and go weekly for that infusion i also start  xeloda which is actually in pill form that i will take twice a day for 7 days and then off for 7 days. sorry that i did taxatere instead of taxol so i can't tell you what to look for but i can tell you that aleve   works well   for  bone and joint pain, take it as soon as you get  neulasta shot don't wait for  pain to set in i found that by being proactive it was just a dull ache instead of  horrible pain i had in  beginning."
419,420,i was told depending on my next scan in may i might continue on abraxane or start afinitor and aromisin combo.
420,421,"hi ladies, had my 1st taxol this morning and   so far had been great  ! so we start with motilium, steroid and antihistamines before  taxol. still had my guard up and ready for what ever taxol throw in my way!"

430,431,"adriamycin or carboplatin withtaxotere. if you read my history in my profile you will see that   i had very bad side effects   with abraxane and  onco at mda said   i exhibited extreme toxicity to it  . so i want to avoid that taxol family if at all possible. so he had also suggested starting low dose adriamycin. i have never had nausea, have not had severe neuropathy, did not get hfs with gemzar or even diarrhea for that matter and have never really had much fatigue although would crash after  premed steriods wore off with different treatments. i will be getting lowdose weekly adriamycin until we find out it is not working. will continue to drop in and post on my normal threads, pets, spirited and more sensible women, my xeloda friends, stage lv chemo, recipes,the hormonals ( boy do i ever wish i could still do those) and  middies since my friend elimar is on there, but this will be  main one i put  results of this drug on. marybeedited 7/16/2012 ca 27/29 results since starting on adriamycin."

444,445,"about  iud, for what it's worth, i was having horrible, frequent periods (peri-menopausal) with tons of breast pain and bloating prior to my diagnosis, but tamoxifen has actually   made all of that much better, with very few annoying side effects   (minor hair loss, occasional hot flushes, and occasional leg cramps, but   none frequent or severe enough to be a real problem  )."
445,446,how long since your last taxol? i'm was onlytaking 1 prilosec which i continued after  taxol.

448,449,
449,450,"taxol was not yet routinely given, although shortly it would be. it was rough for me and i would probably not have done  taxol even if it was offered."
450,451,"finished tc in may '09, finished herceptin in dec. had hot flashes all last summer until i stopped tamoxifen temporarily (onco said i didn't need it if my periods had stopped) but took progesterone cream and that   helped   hot flashes to stop as well. periods began back again march, april and may so am back on tamoxifen, especially since my remaining breast was so tender i could't stand  pain. no more hot flashes now and haven't notcied any s. es either this go around with  tamox  (but i am still doing  progesterone cream so maybe that is off setting any potential hot flashes). i continued with  drippy nose until i was off herceptin completely for about 6 weeks. i also noticed my hair really took off growing after i finished herceptin, even though they say that has nothing to do with it."
451,452,"don was put on sutent following a right liver lobe embolozation procedure done at mayoto make  healthy left liver lobe grow big enough to take over  liver workload, with  surgical plan being to resect  right liver lobe. surgeon up there told our oncologist that if that liver tumor can be shrunk enough, and no spread elsewhere, and  lung tumors (now only 2, down from 6, thanks to lots of prayers, a great oncologistand sutent), can be eradicated or at least stabilized, he will be willing to reconsider a liver resection for don. even if it didn't seem so at  time, i suspect your blessing was that you got  sutent up front of  removal of  kidney and adrenal gland."

461,462,"hi tabatha, i had 4 ac and then 12 weekly taxols. for me  acwas much worse than  taxol. after my first several taxol treatments   i felt really good  . best part of taxol, is that   my hair grew  entire time  ."
462,463,"almost a whole week after taxotere, i have  vivid feeling of eating paper. on  hair, after my 2nd taxotere, my   hair seems to be growing back  ."
463,464,i had my first taxol yesterday. if there is no reaction for 3 weeks they will move to me taking  pre meds orally before chemo and only take an hour to administer  taxol- rather than  3 hours it took yesterday.
464,465,"i had my first on 4/21 and i go back every 3 weeks (3 more rounds of a-c, then 4 rounds of taxotere/carboplatin)."
465,466,"i am in my 5th month of weekly taxol (3 weeks on, one week off). taxol is cumulative and builds up. i've got 5 more treatments to go, then hopefully will get a break and just be on herceptin until progression again."

467,468,"definitely, make certain to at least get a bone density scan just prior to starting femara, and ask for one on an an annual basis thereafter. unfortunately,cannot be going back on femara. femara is known tocause bone loss in users. femara.com website states this right from  onset, look for yourself :) i did not really understand  numbers behind theresults of  original study:http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp? l2=2&l3=6&sid=130&cid=1393&pid=0&catid=02383women were put into  trial.1579 took femara, 804 did not.2% (31) of  1579 women taking letrozole had a recurrence compared with 4.9% (39) of  804 women who chose to not take  drug. women who were ""randomly"" assigned initially got to choose whether they wanted to start taking femara, or take  placebo - this means that these results don't come from a randomized trial. a higher percentage ofwomen who chose to not start taking femara also didn't have chemotherapy, which could have been a factor in their local and distant recurrence rates. but out of2383 women, 31 of  femara takers got a recurrence, vs. 39 recurrence in thosethat did not take femara. it is easy to be persuaded by others when they toss around a number such as, ""well, if you take femara, you have a 60% less chance of recurrence."". my grudge is that my onc should have have a bone density scan done at one year post starting femara (see femara website for their recommendation). having understood  femara test results, and being aware of thechance of getting osteoporisis would havealerted me to pushing my onc. for a bone density test one year after starting (just to make sure my body was handling  femara okay). if  loss was appreciable at one year, my onc and iwould have talked aboutchoosing to stay on femara and hoping it did not worsen, or perhaps look at altenatives such as putting me on tamoxifen (while maybe not as effective as femara, tamox is still   beneficial to post menopausal women, without such high of a risk for bone loss  ). you both are new to femara, so you have a chance to monitor itseffect on your bones. and get 2 rib fractures, just 22 months after taking femara. change of -1.8 down to -4.9 after 22 months on femara is a phenomenal amount (words my doc used). you willlikely not realize bone loss after only a handful of months on femara. i have to stop  femara, i have no choice. maybe tamoxifen. but, general consensus is that this is a direct cause of femara. :(i wonder if  femara/zometa trial is attempting to acertain if  zometa can aid in  bone loss femara users experience? white/caucasian women who are small boned are particularly suseptible to bone loss on femara (something else i did not know."
468,469,taxotere part was a little harder--to me--kind of like having  flu with aches/pains.
469,470,"i had  pains too on arimidex, getting up and moving around a bit   helped  ."
470,471,also talk of weekly taxol instead of every two weeks. weekly taxol is a 12 week treatment versus  4 treatments every other week.
471,472,
472,473,"there are no budgetary contraints on getting femara or what have you immediately they are needed. my op was june 24th, i had a bad infection, i am better now and just completed my first chemo last week (fec, of i think usually called cef in  us) in between times i went onto femara   which was ok  ."
473,474,"on a positive note, i started tamoxifen last week and   so far, knock wood, i have had zero side effects  !"
474,475,june 5th and 26th and then arimidex for5 years.
475,476,after 6 months of a/c and taxol i had a short period off before my surgery.
476,477,i also take an advil in  morning since it   works   with inflammation & helps with  hormonal aches & pains from femara.
477,478,"i have been on lupron and exemestane  since january 2012. had 1tc and 5 cmf (had reaction to taxetere) because path report showed some lyphatic-vascular invasion, then 37 external radiation tx. first month on lupron/exemestane had terrrible depression, days of crying non-stop, hot flashes, joint pain."

479,480,
480,481,i was also a   minimal-se   chemo girl - i had treatments in south florida while i was commuting to dc - and had 33 radiation treatments (also bilateral) and have been taking femara (after a brief round of tamoxifen) since early 2007.
481,482,
482,483,my eye doc said it was tamoxifen toxicity. tamoxifen had caused two ovarian cysts.
483,484,"as you've seen lately,  future of bexxar and zevalin are at great risk because of a cms ruling. feel free to write whatever you wish, and if you aren?t certain what to write, simply copy and paste  following: i respectfully request an immediate reversal of cms-1392-fc as it relates to bexxar and zevalin. zevalin september 2002."

485,486,
486,487,"i had these after chemo, radiation and 2 years tamoxifen which really affected my uterus."
487,488,"beach, i was also afraid of scarring from  taxotere ""burns"" on my face and hands but thankfully that didn't happen. i finished 12 treatments of taxotere in april, and  skin on my face is still super dry. only other side effect was  taxotere did a number on my nails -- they are falling off for a 2nd time."
488,489,i've just started tamoxifen and i've heard sometimes it affects hair growth so will see if that has an impact.
489,490,
490,491,i was pre-meno at dx and could not take tamoxifen--so i had to go on lupron shots monthly and letrozole. i had been toying with going off letrozole--- i still have about 1.5 years on it--- but   so far bones are fine  --  main issue for me is vaginal dryness and lack of libido.
491,492,"lisa - yeast infections - that's somethign that i've not heard for tamox use - i really think you should follow up with gyn about that just in case it's based on something else. jsut about all other psots are things i've had or heard of on tamox, unfortunately! (yes, i choose that option over  one that says my memory cells are fried from tamoxifen and/or chemo!!!) and it's so hard to know what is tamox and what is regular menopause. important in case it wasn't mentioned many times before - it's crucial to see gyn every 6 mos while on tamox to monitor uterine and cervical changes carefully."
492,493,"4 rounds of ac and 4 rounds of ixempra. i'm a bit leary of  ixempra, but it is cutting my treatments in half, so i was willing to try."
493,494,
494,495,"i had a longer than normal course of chemo in 2012 - ac dd, taxol dd, carboplatin (6 months). taxol caused my neuropathy - carboplatin exacerbated."
495,496,)paula - hope your counts are up and you are able to do  taxol. tamoxifen -  mo i saw last week wrote  prescription for this.
496,497,"hi nanda, i really feel for you as i had  same experience on taxotere, my  toe nails and finger nails just looked so bad  , i couldn't find anything to help  regrowth and it took about 6 months for them to look 'normal', i wish there was something i could tell you worked a treat but it was only time that made them look any better, at times i used to cover myfinger nails withbandaids."
497,498,
498,499,
499,500,i took avastin for 6 months with no preload of any other drug. avastin side effects can vary it can cause high blood pressure which can be controlled by medicine. all in all avastin is an   easy drug to tolerate  . i also was on abraxane for 6 months and only had aloxi as my preload drug for anti nausea. i believe benadryl is given to some for abraxane allergy.
500,501,some nerve cells damaged by drugs like taxol and taxotere take longer to repair/replace.
501,502,
502,503,"my first 4 rounds were taxotere & cisplatin, then 4 rounds of adriamycin & cytoxan. i had a allergic reaction to  adriamycin so they had to premedicate me before administating it."

504,505,"after  lumpectomy, my oncologist recommended going on  tamoxifen regimen because of other high risk factors, but told me i'd have to get off prozac. tomorrow i go back to  oncologist to start  tamoxifen."
505,506,"i am on abraxane which is a ""cousin"" to taxol. i really think you will have  same with taxol ."
506,507,i had a hard time with taxotere i think i was given strong doses and even though i complained my doctor only lower a little at  last one.
507,508,"as for  tamoxifen, unfortunately it was not good for me. i went on femara and  bone pain was intolerable so i went on arimidex and   it has been somewhat better  ."
508,509,"you might get some sort of odd ball side effects from  taxotere, mostly  blackening of nails,   but no biggie  ."
509,510,"would a estradiol level (normal lab, not sensitive test) of 19.4 be a reason to go from femara to fulvestrant? i am actually thinking it might be  femara or fosamax, actually i am now on  generic which is a bit more with bone pain, especially at night and in my feet of all places."
510,511,i had abraxane alone (same as taxol but no steroids) last wedesday.
511,512,
512,513,i started taking tamoxifen a few weeks ago and   have not noticed any particular side effects from that  .
